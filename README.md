Code and assorted files for my ISAC Brick prop


This repository is for the code and other assorted files for the ISAC Brick prop I made, based on Tom Clandy's The Division 2 videogame.  

Instructions for creating the hardware and electronics can be found here:

Files for 3D printing can be found here:

There are two folders for Arduino code, one for the audio files that go with the project, and one for the Android app (in progress, not posted yet)
